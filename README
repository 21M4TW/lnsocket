lnsocket
========

A simple C library for sending messages over the lightning network

Work in progress!

Thanks to Rusty and the clightning project for much of this code, I have
adapted it to be more library friendly. I've removed references to tal, Rusty's
hierarchical allocator. The library only allocates once and uses that chunk of
memory for all operations.


Motivation
----------

I wanted a way to send custom messages to my lightning node, such as RPC.
Building this as a simple C library will allow you to speak the lightning
network in native applications, like on mobile.


Dependencies
------------

You'll need libtool/autoconf/automake for the libsodium/secp256k1 submodules,
but otherwise there are no dependencies


Building
--------

$ make


iOS
---

$ make ios

This will build lnsocket.a, libsodium.a and libsecp256k1.a under target/ios for
arm64 and ios-sim.


Examples
--------

* See test.c for a ping/pong example

* See rpc.c for an RPC example
